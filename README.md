# bridge. Jam!

The bridge jam is an event in which addon creators have a week to create an addon themed around a certain topic!

## Why join an add-on jam?

The bridge Jam will be a fun experience, where you can test your skills. After your add-on has been submitted, your addon will be judged and you will receive an overall score. The person with the highest score will win the jam.
